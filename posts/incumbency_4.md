# Incumbency

### Does Incumbency Matter in Elections?
Since 1980, [incumbent reelection rates](https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/reelection-rates) in the House and Senate have rarely fallen below 80%. And the so-called ‘incumbent advantage’ gets even stronger further down the ballot in smaller state and local races. At the presidential level, less than a quarter of incumbents have failed to win reelection if they sought it. Generally speaking, a bet in favor of the incumbent has pretty good odds. 

But studies have shown that all else equal, voters care little about incumbency in and of itself [(Brown, 2014)](https://www-cambridge-org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/ECFE39E003912F8AF65C2AD14A34BD8C/S2052263014000062a.pdf/div-class-title-voters-don-t-care-much-about-incumbency-div.pdf). So what gives incumbent candidates their seemingly enormous advantage? One notable advantage is name recognition, particularly in down-ballot races where opposition candidates might not get a lot of organic press. Incumbents can also literally start ahead in the race and functionally begin campaigning for reelection the moment they enter office. An opposition candidate might not file to run until years later. Both of these advantages also translate into [fundraising dollars](https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/incumbent-advantage). 


### Impact of Federal Grant Spending
Finally, depending on the office, incumbents can also allocate spending in a way that appeals to voters. [Kriner and Reaves (2015)](https://hollis.harvard.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_cdi_proquest_journals_1018073231&context=PC&vid=HVD2&search_scope=everything&tab=everything&lang=en_US) examine the impact of federal spending in presidential elections. They find that at the county level, increases in federal grants are associated with increases in incumbent vote shares, particularly in competitive states. 

A simple model assessing the impact of increases in federal spending on incumbent vote shares at the county level, with a term for the interaction between spending and state competitiveness, yields the following results.

**These results confirm that voters do appear to reward incumbents when their counties receive additional federal funding.** At the county level, for every one percent increase in spending, incumbents receive an additional 0.48 points when they seek reelection. This more than doubles to 1.12 points in competitive states. Given that Donald Trump won Michigan by [0.23%](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/michigan) in 2016, it’s not difficult to imagine how federal spending, deployed strategically, could fundamentally alter the course of an election. 

It seems like some politicians already know this. By and large presidents employ a strategy known as ‘electoral particularism’ that entails funneling more federal dollars to electorally competitive areas. On average, swing states receive around 30% more federal funding than noncompetitive core states, and experience a bump during election years [(Kriner and Reaves, 2015)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/presidential-particularism-and-dividethedollar-politics/962ABE4FC41A6FF3E1F95CE1B54D1ADD). 


### COVID-19 Relief Allocation
In response to COVID-19, the federal government rolled out a financial relief effort of [historic proportions](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/25/818881845/senate-reaches-historic-deal-on-2t-coronavirus-economic-rescue-package). Given the impact federal spending can have on county attitudes towards incumbents, and the historic trend towards electoral particularism, it’s interesting to see how grants have been apportioned based on data from the [Department of Health and Human Services](https://taggs.hhs.gov/coronavirus).

While a number of [key swing states](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/08/swing-states-2020-presidential-election-409000) including Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have received noticeably more funding than the average state, they have also been legitimately [hard-hit](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html#:~:text=The%20places%20hit%20hardest,identified%20more%20than%20700%2C000%20cases.) by COVID-19. Furthermore, federal funding seems more evenly distributed when visualized based on spending-per-capita.
