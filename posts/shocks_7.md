# Shocks
## October 24, 2020

We know fundamentals arenâ€™t the only factors that influence elections. Partisanship, political cycles, campaigns, and a host of other factors play a role in determining who comes out on top on election day. Electoral politics and predictions are always complicated, but as everything else, they seem 10x more complicated in 2020. Shocks and calamities, political and otherwise, play a noticeable role in election outcomes. [Research suggests](https://hollis.harvard.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_59783343&context=PC&vid=HVD2&search_scope=everything&tab=everything&lang=en_US)  that state-level deaths resulting from the war in Iraq significantly depressed incumbent vote shares (Karol & Miguel, 2007). Natural disasters like [tornados](https://hollis.harvard.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_cdi_crossref_primary_10_1561_100_00009057&context=PC&vid=HVD2&search_scope=everything&tab=everything&lang=en_US) can also influence outcomes (Healy, 2010). 

While research suggests that even shocks beyond policymaker control, like [shark attacks](https://hollis.harvard.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_cdi_crossref_primary_10_1086_699244&context=PC&vid=HVD2&search_scope=everything&tab=everything&lang=en_US), can cause voters to irrationally penalize incumbents, results from those studies have been difficult to replicate and have limited external (and internal) validity (Fowler and Hall, 2018). And even seemingly apolitical shocks like tornados only affect incumbents when policy responses are lacking.
