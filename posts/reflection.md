# Post-Election Reflection
## November 24, 2020

For [my last blog post](final_prediction.md) I built a model based on polling, demography, state voting history, and incumbency to predict state-by-state two-party vote share in the 2020 Presidential Election. I predicted that Joe Biden would win the presidency with 312 electoral college votes to Donald Trump’s 226. 

In terms of Electoral College results, this model did pretty well. **It accurately predicted every state but Iowa**, and overpredicted Biden’s electoral college margin by the state’s six votes. (Notably, I did not split districts in my predictions for Maine and Nebraska, though ME-2 and NE-2 ended up cancelling each other out.)
