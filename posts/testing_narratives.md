# Testing Election Narratives: Social Media and Polarization
## December 10, 2020

Since its inception, the role of social media in the modern political landscape has become increasingly significant and controversial. Social media use has grown exponentially over the past decade and a half. In 2005, only 5% of US adults used social media. By 2019, that number had grown to nearly [80%](https://ourworldindata.org/rise-of-social-media). Politics has responded to this trend, with [both Trump and Biden’s presidential campaigns](https://abc7.com/presidential-race-campaign-spending-trump-political-ads-biden/7452228/) setting records for social media ad spending in 2020. Its rapid rise has also been disruptive, and it is no wonder that there is substantial discourse around how social media affects day-to-day life, interactions, and of course, politics.

One key narrative about the effect that social media has on politics revolves around its power to polarize. Social media algorithms can create [“filter bubbles”](https://www.vox.com/recode/21534345/polarization-election-social-media-filter-bubble) where people on platforms overwhelmingly see content from other members and pages that share views similar to their own. [Centralized echo chamber networks](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-social-media-makes-us-more-polarized-and-how-to-fix-it/) in particular can amplify partisan bias, or so the story goes. There is also [evidence](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/37/9216) that exposure to opposing political views, particularly the kind that exist on social media, can actually increase polarization. 

And it is true that American politics has become substantially more polarized over the course of the past few election cycles. Time even [went so far](https://time.com/5907318/polarization-2020-election/) as to say that “polarization is the only clear winner” of the 2020 presidential election. Deepening political divides have roughly coincided with the rise of social media. Relatively few would claim that social media has been solely responsible for this trend, but what role does it play?
